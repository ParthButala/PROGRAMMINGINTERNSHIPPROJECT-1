Random Username Generator

Project Overview

The Random Username Generator is a Python-based application that creates unique and fun usernames suitable for social media, gaming platforms, or other online accounts. The program allows users to customize their username preferences, including the use of numbers, special characters, and desired length.

This project is designed for both beginners and experienced programmers who want to explore Python's capabilities in randomization, file handling, and user interaction. It serves as a great way to practice fundamental Python programming concepts while creating a useful tool.

Features

Generates usernames by combining random adjectives and nouns (e.g., CoolTiger123!).

Allows users to:

Specify the number of usernames to generate.

Include/exclude numbers.

Include/exclude special characters.

Set the length of the username (6 to 15 characters).

Usage:

This program is ideal for those looking for creative and secure usernames for various online platforms. It ensures users can generate a username that meets their preferences without manually coming up with unique names.

Future Improvements

Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.

Adding an option to generate usernames based on user preferences (e.g., themes like fantasy, sci-fi, or professional).

Including a database of words to create even more unique and varied usernames.

Enhancing security features by incorporating password generation along with usernames.

Error handling to prevent invalid inputs and unexpected crashes.
